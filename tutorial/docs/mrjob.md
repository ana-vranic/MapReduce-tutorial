# mrjob

  mrjob is a Python MapReduce library that wraps Hadoop streaming and allows us to write the MapReduce programs in a more Pythonic manner. With mrjob, it is possible to write multistep jobs. mrjob programs can be tested locally, run on the Hadoop cluster, and run in the Amazon cloud using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR).

- instalation ```$ pip install mrjob ```

In mrjob, the MapReduce function is defined as class MRClass, which contains the methods that define the MapReduce job:

 - the mapper() defines the mapper. It takes (key, values) as arguments and yields tuppels (output_key, output_valies)

 - the combiner() defines the process that runs after the mapper and before the reducer. It receives all data from the mapper, and the output of the paper is sent to the reducer. The combinerâ€™s input is the key, yielded by the mapper, and a value, which is a generator that yields all values yielded by one mapper that corresponds to the key. The combiner yields tuples of (output_key, output_value) as output.
 
 - the reducer() defines the reducer for the MapReduce job. It takes a key and an iterator of values as arguments and yields tuples of (outup_key, output_value)

- The final component is, which enables the execution of mrjob. 

``` py
if __name__ == '__main__':

    MRClass.run()
```

### Word count example with mrjob

We will perform a word count on Moby Dick book downloaded from project Gutenberg
``` sh
wget "https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701.txt"
```

mrjob script wordcount_mrjob.py: 

``` py title="mrjob_wc.py"
from mrjob.job import MRJob
import re

WORD_REGEX = re.compile(r"[\w]+")
class MRWordCount(MRJob):

    def mapper(self, _, line):
        for word in WORD_REGEX.findall(line):
            yield word.lower(), 1


    def reducer(self, word, counts):
        yield(word, sum(counts))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    MRWordCount.run()



```

To run it localy:

``` sh
$ python wordcount_mrjob.py 'pg2701.txt'
```

We can execute the mrjob locally:  ```$ python mrjob.py input.txt```. The mrjob writes output to stout. To save results to file we can run  ```$ python mrjob.py input.txt > out.txt```
We can also pass the multiple files ```$ python mrjob.py input.txt input2.txt input3.txt```. 

Finally, with the ```-runner/-r``` option, we can define how the job executes. If the job executes in the Hadoop cluster  ```$ python mrjob.py -r hadoop input.txt``` If we run it on the EMR cluster  ```$ python mrjob.py -r emr s3://input-bucket/input.txt ```.

### Chaining map-reduce

With mrjob, we can easily chain several map-reduce functions. For example, if we need to calculate the word with maximum frequency in the dataset. To do that, we need to override the steps() method. The code will have a mapper and reducer, the same as in the previous task. Then, the second mapper uses the reducer's output, which maps all (word, count) pairs to the same key, None. The shuffle step of map-reduce will collect them all into one list corresponding to the key None. Then reducer_post will sort the list of (word, word_count) pairs by word_count and yield the word with maximum frequency. 

``` py title="mrjob_wf.py"
from mrjob.job import MRJob
from mrjob.step import MRStep
import re

WORD_REGEX = re.compile(r"[\w]+")

class MRMaxFreq(MRJob):

    def steps(self):
        return [
            MRStep(mapper=self.mapper,
                   reducer=self.reducer),
            MRStep(mapper=self.mapper_2,
                   reducer=self.reducer_2)
        ]

    def mapper(self, _, line):
        for word in WORD_REGEX.findall(line):
            yield word.lower(), 1

    def reducer(self, word, counts):
        yield word, sum(counts)


    # keys: None, values: (word, word_count)
    def mapper_2(self, word, word_count):
        yield None, (word, word_count)

    # sort list of (word, word_count) by word_count
    def reducer_2(self, _, word_count_pairs):
        yield max(word_count_pairs, key=lambda p: p[1],)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    MRMaxFreq().run()

```

We run it as previous, additionaly the output can be  redirected to the file "max_freq_word.txt"

``` sh
$ python word_freq_mrjob.py 'pg20701.txt' > 'max_freq_word.txt'
$ cat 'max_freq_word.txt'
"the" 14620
```

### Passing arguments to mrjob

Getting Williams sisters rivaly with MRJob. Here we will select matches when 'Serena Williams' and 'Venus Williams' played against eachother, and calculate how many times each sister won depending on the surface. 

``` py title="mrjob_williams.py"
from mrjob.job import MRJob
from functools import reduce

def make_counts(acc, nxt):
    acc[nxt] = acc.get(nxt,0) + 1
    return acc

def my_freq(xs):
    return reduce(make_counts, xs, {})

class Williams(MRJob):

    def mapper(self, _, line):
        fields = line.split(',')
        players = [fields[10], fields[18]] #(winner, loser)
        if 'Serena Williams' in players and 'Venus Williams' in players:
            yield fields[2], fields[10]

    def reducer(self, surface, results):
        counts = my_freq(results)
        yield surface, counts

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Williams.run()
```
``` sh 
python mrjob_wiliams.py tennis_wta-master/wta_matches_*
```

Instead of overcoding the script with 'Serena Williams' and Venus Williams we can pass arguments to mrjob using passargs option.  

``` py title="mrjob_2players.py"
from mrjob.job import MRJob
from functools import reduce

def make_counts(acc, nxt):
    acc[nxt] = acc.get(nxt,0) + 1
    return acc

def my_freq(xs):
    return reduce(make_counts, xs, {})

class Williams(MRJob):

    def configure_args(self):
        super(Williams, self).configure_args()
        self.add_passthru_arg("-p1", "--player1", help="player1")
        self.add_passthru_arg("-p2", "--player2", help="player1")


    def mapper(self, _, line):
        fields = line.split(',')
        players = [fields[10], fields[18]]
        if self.options.player1 in players and self.options.player2 in players:
            yield fields[2], fields[10]

    def reducer(self, surface, results):
        counts = my_freq(results)
        yield surface, counts

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Williams.run()
```

``` sh
python3 mrjob_2players.py tennis_wta-master/wta_matches_* --player1 "Serena Williams" --player2 "Venus Williams"
```
